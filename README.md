CARTER'S GREAT IDEA

Base-8/Hexadecimal ENCODER

Takes Ascii characters and turns them into hexidecimal number code.

GOAL: Attempt to CONDENSE the framework of converting ascii to HEX into a smaller state.

OPTIONAL EXPANSIONS:

SHOW how the ascii was converted to hex
user has the OPTION to encode further and turn that into binary as well.
CHOICE for other encoding styles ( binary? octal? BASE64? )
